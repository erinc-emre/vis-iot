# Vis-IoT

Application that provides artificial intelligence supported vision to iot systems

## Scope

Vis-IoT is a platform that allows image processing on IoT systems locally or on the cloud.
The system can be used in two ways, cloud or local. The system works with IP cameras and signal receiving devices (such as relays and PLCs) in both options.

## Development Fields

### Web - Desktop Application

- It will run on the web interface to increase accessibility. With this
  interface, users will be able to monitor their devices in the field.
- It will be done using Frontend React and Next JS.
- Firebase auth system will be used for user login.

### Machine Learning

- Machine learning will be used for visual processing.
- A special model will be trained using Tensorflow and integrated into the system.

### Cloud

- Image processing algorithms will work in the cloud environment. For this, an development will be made on Google Cloud using Kubernetes and FastAPI.

### Network

- In cloud systems, communication will be provided over the MQTT protocol. I will use Google Cloud IoT solutions.
- Communication will be provided over HTTPS in the web system. The application will deployed on Vercel.

## Learning Golas

I will use the Learn and Apply method as I will use many technologies that I do not know yet throughout the project.

### Web - Desktop Application

- To update my current knowledge of React and Next JS, learn more about Firebase Auth and Firestore.

### Machine Learning

- Finishing the Udacity Tensorflow ML program
- Actively reviewing Notebooks on Kaggle and participating in various competitions.

### Cloud

- Taking Kubernetes, FastAPI and Google Cloud trainings

### Network

- Taking Google Cloud IoT training

## Time Line

- There is a 12-week development period. Since the trainings can be held simultaneously, it is very difficult to create a precise calendar.
- The application is being developed using the Waterfall model. For the Test and Validation stages, the implementation is planned to be finished in 10 weeks.
- On the website, the progress of the application will be shown on the roadmap and the operations will be explained on a weekly basis.
