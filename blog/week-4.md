# Backend
Our criteria as a backend; Being fast, having community support, and being up to date. In this direction, Fast API is suitable for our needs. It's a nice advantage to have lots of current examples to use while developing (NextJS is very good at this).

Basically, we have 3 tasks:
 - Reading and writing data from the database
 - Running the Machine Learning Model
 - Trigger IoT Devices

I know IoT Devices can be triggered with AWS Lambda Functions but I need to do more research on this. The IoT Core Service provides very large and wide-ranging services.

We will do database and ML operations with Fast API. This week, I dockerized and used the simple ML model using Fast API for learning purposes. I really liked the system logic and I started doing some more general research.

Setting up a digital system, operating the system, source control, data routing. Establishing these structures in large projects is a very important step. I came to understand these concepts better as the project progressed. It seems that those who work on large-scale projects need to improve themselves on System Architecture. I have already taken this subject among my short-term plans.

See you next sunday,\
