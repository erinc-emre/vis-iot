Hello and welcome to the first Vis-IoT blog. I am Erinc Emre, and I will briefly talk about the studies carried out this week, the experiences learned and the status of the project.

I started the week with an intense workout. It is very exciting to do a multidisciplinary project using many modern technologies. However, there are many unknowns due to the scope of the project. These unknowns can sometimes be stressful. I started my studies on paper (the power of paper and pen should not be underestimated!)

There are 4 domains in the project;
- Web
- Machine Learning
- Cloud
